  <h3>LIL NAS X</h3>
  <p>Montreo, a.k.a. Lil Nas X, is this month's top celebrity! One of QueerOut's biggest supporters, Montreo has even volunteered at some of the events listed in our events section! 

    His history is as follows: 
    Since Lil Nas X came out as gay to the public at the height of his "Old Town Road" success, the release of his first full album was essential to his own recovery. I love jokes, but on a serious note, making this album was therapy for me, he wrote on Twitter after its release. "I started healing many unhealed wounds, confronting skeletons in my closet I never wanted to, struggling every day inside and crying ceaselessly."</p>
